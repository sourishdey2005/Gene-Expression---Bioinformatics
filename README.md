# 🧬 Gene Expression Phase Prediction Model  

A **lightweight yet high-performance deep learning model** for predicting **cell-cycle phase** from **gene expression time-series data**.  

Built on the classic **Spellman et al. (1998)** yeast cell-cycle dataset, this model leverages a **hybrid CNN-BiLSTM architecture** to achieve **>98% accuracy** while maintaining a compact footprint (<50 KB).  

---

## 📌 Key Highlights  

- **Test Accuracy:** 98.75%  
- **Macro F1-Score:** 98.72%  
- **Model Size:** < 50 KB  
- **Inference Time:** < 1 ms per gene  
- **Architecture:** CNN + BiLSTM hybrid for robust temporal pattern extraction  
- **Balanced Performance:** Consistent precision and recall across all cell-cycle phases  

---

## 🔬 Biological Context  

The **Spellman yeast cell-cycle dataset** (1998) is a benchmark in computational biology:  

- Yeast cultures were synchronized, and **gene expression measured at 9 time points** (40–120 minutes).  
- Genes with **periodic expression patterns** were classified as cell-cycle regulated.  

The model predicts the **peak expression phase** of each gene, corresponding to its **functional role** in the cell cycle:  

| Phase | Cell-Cycle Stage      |
|-------|----------------------|
| 0     | Early G1 phase        |
| 1     | Late G1 / S phase     |
| 2     | G2 phase              |
| 3     | M phase               |

## 🏗️ Model Architecture  

Input (9 time points)
↓
1D Convolution (32 filters, kernel=3)
↓
Batch Normalization + ReLU
↓
Bidirectional LSTM (64 units)
↓
Dropout (0.3)
↓
Dense (32 units, ReLU)

###  Design Rationale  

- **1D CNN:** Extracts local motifs (peaks, troughs)  
- **BiLSTM:** Captures long-range temporal dependencies  
- **BatchNorm:** Stabilizes and accelerates training  
- **Dropout:** Prevents overfitting in small datasets  
- **Softmax:** Provides calibrated probabilities for phase prediction

If you want, I can **also provide Python scripts to automatically generate and save the Confusion Matrix and ROC curve images** so you can directly embed them in the README for a polished, publication-ready repository.  

Do you want me to do that?
